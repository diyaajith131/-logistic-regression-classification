# -logistic-regression-classification
This repository contains an implementation of binary classification using Logistic Regression. The project includes data preprocessing, train-test split, feature standardization, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. The sigmoid function and threshold tuning are also demonstrated.

Tools used: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)
